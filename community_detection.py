"""
Implements the four community detection methods (Modularity, Infomap, Spectral and SBM).

Due to the methods originating from various authors and programming languages,
the purpose of this file is to provide a single cohesive Python interface to the four methods.

    Returns the community partition identified by the Modularity method,

    Parameters
    ----------

    ----------

def get_spectral_communities(G):
    """
    Returns the community partition identified by the Spectral method,
    i.e. a list containing the community assignment of each node.

    Note: the MATLAB code for the Spectral method takes a GML file as input, 
    so this function creates a file with the network saved in this format.

def get_sbm_communities(G):
    """
    Returns the community partition identified by the SBM method,
    i.e. a list containing the community assignment of each node.

    Note: the algorithm runs multiple trials due to the stochastic nature of the method
    (selecting the partition with the minimum description length).
    The number of trials can be varied in the code, if required.
